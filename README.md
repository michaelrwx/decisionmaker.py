# decisionmaker.py
Made for those who can't make any decisions! 

The numbers are up to you. Let's say you want to decide between three restaurants. In your head, you assign a restaurant to a number. 
(Example: 1 for Bonefish Grill, 2 for Primo Hoagies, and 3 for Denny's)

I don't recommend using this program for high numbers, the time.sleep() function makes the suspense very fun.
